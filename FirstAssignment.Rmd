## Who am I? :man_technologist:

My name is Serhan Bayram. I graduated from Bilkent University Industrial Engineering Department in 2016. Currently I am working as Business Intelligence Analyst at ModaCruz, an e-commerce company, mostly focused on second-hand. My main responsibilities are: 

* Analyzing companyâ€™s data in order to assist decision making processes 
* Developing data analysis models and gathering actionable insights  
* Visualizing data 
* Preparing regular and ad-hoc reports

My data interests started in my university years. My major is mostly related with data, and I saw the power and the future of the data. Also, in one of my internships I had a chance to get involved with data analysis and data visualization. After that internship I decided to improve myself in this field. 

I am planning to use my data science skills to offer more personalized experience to our users in order to increase revenue and retention.
