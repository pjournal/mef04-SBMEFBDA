### __Who am I?__

My name is Serhan Bayram. I graduated from Bilkent University Industrial Engineering Department in 2016. Currently I am working as Business Intelligence Analyst at ModaCruz, an e-commerce company, mostly focused on second-hand. My main responsibilities are:

* Analyzing companyâ€™s data in order to assist decision making processes 
* Developing data analysis models and gathering actionable insights  
* Visualizing data 
* Preparing regular and ad-hoc reports

My data interests started in my university years. My major is mostly related with data, and I saw the power and the future of the data. Also, in one of my internships I had a chance to get involved with data analysis and data visualization. After that internship I decided to improve myself in this field. 

I am planning to use my data science skills to offer more personalized experience to our users in order to increase revenue and retention.

This package has an point and click interface, which allows the users to create an app by selecting some variables. In the video it is mentioned that this package is currently in development process. For the future, Package Dependencies, Drag and Drop interface and Platform-agnostic Deployment are planned developments.
